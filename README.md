# Security Requirement: Authentication and Authorization

All endpoints and operations must enforce authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.

## Requirements
- Require user authentication before allowing access to arithmetic operations.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if different user roles are supported.
- Securely manage sessions and tokens to prevent session hijacking.
